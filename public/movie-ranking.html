<h1>The Best Movies Ever Made According to Me</h1>
<h2>Here are 3 of my best movie choices</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Jurassic Park (1993)</h3>
 <p>As a kid, this movie marked me. The dinosaur 3D models by the time and the ideas behind it, was and still his one of my biggest dream. Who wouldn't like to see how dinosaur really looked like?</p>
<h3>Cars (2006)</h3>
 <p>Another all-time favorite for my inner-child. This movie with its awesome graphics, history, and humor remains as one of my favorite until this day.</p>
<h3>Warfare (2025)</h3>
 <p>Even though, I only watched it one time, I don't think I would get over this movie. Stunning and realistic, best war movie ever. *Bloody & Not For Everyone*</p>
